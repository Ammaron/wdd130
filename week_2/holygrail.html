                <h2>What is the Holy Grail?</h2>
                <p>A quote from wikipedia says: "The Holy Grail (French: Saint Graal, Breton: Graal Santel, Welsh: Greal Sanctaidd, Cornish: Gral) is a treasure that serves as an important motif in Arthurian literature. Various traditions describe the Holy Grail as a cup, dish, or stone with miraculous healing powers, sometimes providing eternal youth or sustenance in infinite abundance, often guarded in the custody of the Fisher King and located in the hidden Grail castle. By analogy, any elusive object or goal of great significance may be perceived as a "holy grail" by those seeking such."

                <h2>What is the Origin of the Holy Grail?</h2>
                <p>A quote from Britannica says: "The legend of the Grail possibly was inspired by Greek, Roman, and Celtic mythologies, which abound in horns of plenty, magic life-restoring caldrons, and the like. The first extant text to give such a vessel Christian significance as a mysterious holy object was Chrétien de Troyes’s late 12th-century unfinished romance Perceval; ou, le conte du Graal, which introduces the guileless rustic knight Perceval, whose dominant trait is innocence and who quests for the Grail. In this poem, the religious is combined with the fantastic. In the 13th century, Robert de Boron’s verse trilogy Joseph d’Arimathie, Merlin, and Perceval (sometimes called, together, the Estoire dou Graal) extended the Christian significance of the legend, while Wolfram von Eschenbach gave it profound and mystical expression in his epic Parzival. (In Wolfram’s account, the Holy Grail became a precious stone, fallen from heaven.)"
